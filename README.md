# Vehicle_ObjectApproach

1. Create C# console application to take and print the following â€“

a. Car information: Model No., Year Make, Number of Seat, Number of Gear, Number of Door, Engine Capacity in CC, Interior Design, Vehicle Type.

b. Motorcycle information: Model No., Year Make, Number of Gear, Starting Method, Engine Capacity in CC, Maximum Power in BPH, Maximum Torque in NM, Mileage in KMPL, Cooling, Front Brake, Rear Brake, Exterior Design, Vehicle Type.

c. Apply object approach of OOP.

 The application will follow the following instructions strictly:

a.Principle of OOP must be followed/used to develop the application.

b. TwoWheeler and FourWheeler must inherit Vehicle. Car must inherit FourWheeler and Motorcycle must inherit TwoWheeler. Vehicle cannot be instantiated. Car and Motorcycle cannot be inherited.

c. Interior and Exterior Design must be implemented. TwoWheeler will implement Exterior Design. FourWheeler will implement Interior Design. Interior and Exterior Designs are unlimited.

d. Enum will be used for Vehicle Type.

e. Interface implementation

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code in the form of methods and properties. It is a popular programming approach used in C# and other languages.

In OOP, classes define the blueprint for objects. An object is an instance of a class, created using the `new` keyword. The class specifies the data members (properties) and methods that are used to manipulate the data.

Encapsulation is a key feature of OOP. It is the practice of hiding implementation details and exposing a public interface to the user. This is achieved by using access modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal`. A class can also be abstract, which means that it cannot be instantiated, but can be inherited by other classes.

Inheritance is another important concept in OOP. It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from a base class, making it easy to reuse code and create hierarchies of related classes. A class can only inherit from one base class, but can implement multiple interfaces.

Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows a class to take on multiple forms. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time and run-time. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, while run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding.

Overall, the object-oriented approach provides a powerful way to organize and structure code, making it easier to write, maintain, and extend complex applications.
